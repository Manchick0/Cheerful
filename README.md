# Cheerful
A themed way to express your emotions.

Cheerful is a **resource-pack** that introduces multiple emojis into the game by changing what's already there.

Unicode has **thousands** of emojis. It's physically impossible to support all of them, but luckily - it's not even needed. See, the **majority** of existing
Unicode emojis are combinations of ones. They use what is called a **Zero-Width-Joiner** to fuse two characters together into a completely new one. Minecraft, with its limited emoji support, **cannot handle**
any emojis that use the ZWJ.

Therefore, only around a **1000 emojis** are actually **implementable** in the first place.

> [!NOTE]
> Cheerful currently supports around 100 of different emojis for **all** use cases.

# Contributing

A nice way to contribute to the project is, of course, **suggesting your own emojis**! It helps **a lot** to understand which emojis are essential, and which ones can be left out.

Since 1000 emojis is an ambitious number, Cheerful keeps track of which emojis are **already done `✅`**, **not done yet `❌`**, and **are blacklisted `⛔`**. Before suggesting your emoji, please take a look at the [To-Do](/todo.json) list and ensure it's **not already done `❌`**.

If the emoji you want to suggest is indeed **neither** blacklisted, **nor** already done, you can feel free to suggest it in the [Workshop](https://discord.gg/ANntBKUPmC). Others can **upvote** your emoji by reacting to your suggestion with an up-arrow `⬆️`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please be aware that your emoji wouldn't automatically be **accepted**, it might also get **blacklisted**!
